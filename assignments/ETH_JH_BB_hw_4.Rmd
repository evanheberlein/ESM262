## Instructions 

Write a function that takes a vector of fish names and always returns three items

* the most common fish, 

* the rarest fish

* the total number of fish

AND

 include an option (defaulted to FALSE) that if TRUE also returns a histogram of the number of each fish type, with a .  Remember that you can save a graph as a variable.
 
 need to add title giving the total number of fish caught (from `sprintf`)
 
```{r}
fish <- read_tsv(here("assignments", "data", "fish.txt"))
all_fish <- as.vector(fish[["x"]])
  
```
 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# call function (enter plot = TRUE as second argument to view plot)
fish_counts(all_fish)
```
